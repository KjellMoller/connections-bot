# Connections Bot
This project is a personal project designed to solve the NYT connections puzzles available at https://www.nytimes.com/games/connections. 

The tensorflow model is trained using word2vec embeddings generated by the global vectors for word representation model: https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/. 

# User Guide
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed.
2. Download one of the pre-trained GloVe models from https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/, place the .txt file inside of /connections-bot/data-processing/GloVe-models/.
3. From the root directory of the project, with chromedriver installed, run ```data-collection/webscrape.py```. This will create a csv file of all of the past connections games from the archives being collected.
4. Run ```data-processing/data_preprocessing.py``` to apply transformations to the data prior to training and validating.
5. Run ```model_training.py``` to create the keras model, followed by ```model_validate.py``` to validate the model.
6. Once the model is created, run ```solve_connections.py``` with the puzzleid field set as the connections puzzle wanting to be solved. This will apply the model to the connections puzzle and solve it.
